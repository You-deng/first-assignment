# why computer science?

I think the main reason of why someone would want to study computer science is because it's closely related to almost everything in our life now.

I come from China, and I went to China this summer. People's use of digital really shocked me. In China, everyone use phone to pay for everything: bus, taxi, restaurant, grocery, hotel...All you need to do is use payment app to Scanning QR code and type in the amount of money you want to pay. That is way more easier than carry a thick pile of cash or cards with you and sometimes need to worry about find change or lose it. If your phone is out of energy, there's shared portable battery in almost any mall. At home, if you feel hungry and lazy to cook, you can just move your finger to order food online and 20 minutes later your food will be arrived. If you think it's unsafe for a stranger to come to your house to deliver something, you can ask them to put it in a nearby express storage station and walk there enter the password to get your thing. If you want to go out, you can order taxi on your phone or use your phone to pay 1 chinese yuan(60 baisa) for a ofo shared bike or pay for a shared car in a prize of 0.25 yuan(15 baisa) every minutes + 1.25 yuan(75 baisa)every kilometer.

The development of digital is really amaizing and convenient for people's life. I think this is probably the most attractive place which makes someone want to know about it. It's also the reason of why I choose to take this class.
